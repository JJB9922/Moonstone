**Phase 1: Application Framework**

**Project Setup**

- [x] C++ Proj Setup
- [x] CMAKE
- [x] GIT
- [x] DOCS

**Application Loop**

- [x] Create main loop
- [x] State management

**Windowing System**

- [x] Implement cross-platform window creation (using GLFW, SDL, or WinAPI).
- [x] Set up basic window events (resize, close, focus).

**Event System**

- [x] Basic event system
- [x] Implement custom events
- [x] event propagation and handling

**Input System**

- [x] Implement keyboard input handling.
- [x] Implement mouse input handling.
- [x] Integrate input handling into the event system.
- [ ] game controllers (optional)

**Logging**

- [x] Set up a logging system for debugging and status reporting.
- [x] Implement log levels (info, warning, error etc).
- [x] log output to a console and file.


### **Phase 2: Rendering System**

**Graphics Initialization**

- [ ] Set up a graphics API (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX).

- [ ] Create a rendering context and initialize the API.

**Basic 2D/3D Rendering**

- [ ] Implement a basic rendering pipeline.

- [ ] Create a system for rendering 2D sprites and simple 3D objects.

- [ ] Set up shaders (vertex, fragment).

**Camera System**

- [ ] Implement a basic camera system.

- [ ] Support different camera types (perspective, orthographic).

- [ ] Integrate camera movement with input.

**Render Loop Integration**

- [ ] Integrate the rendering system into the application loop.

- [ ] Implement double buffering for smooth rendering.

### **Phase 3: ImGui Integration**

**ImGui Setup**

- [x] Integrate ImGui into the engine.

- [x] Set up an ImGui context and initialization code.

- [x] Implement a basic ImGui rendering pipeline (hook into your existing rendering loop).

**Debug UI with ImGui**

- [ ] Create a basic in-engine debug UI (FPS counter, memory usage).

- [ ] Implement real-time editing of engine parameters (e.g., camera position, light intensity).

- [ ] Set up windows for viewing and editing component properties.
